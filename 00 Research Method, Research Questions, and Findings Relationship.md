# Research Method, Research Questions, and Findings Relationship

We have revised the methods section to clearly explain how our approach addresses the research questions (RQs) and derives our findings. To provide a clear understanding of the relationships between methods, findings, and RQs, we have:

- Included a **figure** showing the relationship between methods and RQs.
- Included a **table** summarizing the connections between methods, findings, and RQs.

These visuals help to clearly present these relationships.

### **Research Method and Research Question Relationship**

The following figure demonstrates the relationship between different research methods and how they address the research questions (RQs):

- **Case Study**: Provides a framework for understanding Web3 auditing and serves as an empirical foundation for analyzing **RQ1** and **RQ2**.
- **Interview Study**: Offers qualitative insights across **all RQs**.
- **Reddit Analysis**: Supplements and cross-validates the findings from interviews.

### **Research Method, Findings, and RQs Relationship**

The table below summarizes the relationship between research methods, findings, and RQs. A check mark indicates which method contributed to a specific finding.
The **interview method** is the main driver for findings across all RQs. **Case study** and **Reddit analysis** provide **empirical verification** and broader insights, enhancing the robustness of the results.

- **Interview Method**:    **Primary source** for most findings. This method captured users' subjective perceptions through open-ended questions and flexible conversation formats, addressing all RQs.
- **Case Study**:  This method allows us to summarize the types, content, and quality of the auditing information users received.
  Specifically, our **case study** yielded two key results:

  - **Framework for Understanding Web3 Auditing**  
    - This established a **comprehensive framework** for understanding the **interaction of auditing** in the Web3 ecosystem
    - Crucial in supporting the subsequent interview design.

  - **Empirical Findings from Audit Firm Homepage Review**  
    This provided **empirical validation** for the interview findings. The results from this review contributed to the following key insights:

    - **Findings Related to RQ1**:
      - Highlighted the **insufficiency in the comprehensiveness** of information types disclosed, as noted in Section IV-B.

    - **Findings Related to RQ2**:
      - Identified the **lack of detailed disclosure**, such as missing price information (Section V-B3)
      - Identified the **provision of additional security education materials** (Section V-A3).

**Reddit Analysis**: This method captured user perceptions by categorizing key topics and performing sentiment analysis to understand user attitudes in community discussions on auditing, addressing all RQs. Two types of analyses were conducted:

1. **Qualitative Analysis**:
   - Based on **thematic categorization**, which cross-validates the interview findings.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Focused on **sentiment analysis**, adjusted to capture the online community's attitudes.
   - These results are used in two ways:
     - To analyze discussions **directly** addressing the role of auditing, as presented in Section V-B.
     - To **indirectly** assess the **impact of auditing** by analyzing the community's attitudes towards different types of audit results for applications, as presented in Section VI-A2.
