Participant eligibility for our interviews is confirmed through textual communication prior to the commencement of the interviews. Only participants who meet our criteria are selected for the interviews. 
Our interviewing process employs a laddered questioning technique to progressively delve into participants' comprehensive perceptions. 
We begin by exploring the interviewees' experiences with questions such as, 'Could you elaborate on some of the Web3 auditing tasks you remember?' We then inquire in detail about their experiences throughout this process, focusing on aspects such as the information related to the audit (for Research Question 1, RQ1), the auditing mechanisms, processes, and participants (for RQ2), as well as interactions with the auditing information (for RQ3).
Subsequently, we pose follow-up questions regarding the framework of knowledge used to shape actions, such as, 'What channels do you usually use to obtain Web3 auditing information?' and 'In what contexts do you typically learn about audits?' 
Finally, we explore questions of personal philosophy, such as, 'How do you perceive this information? Why do you think that way?' and 'What is your view on the role of auditing? Do you think it is valuable to you/the industry/Web3?' These questions aim to foster a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Research Questions.
The detailed interview protocol can be found in our public online dataset.
