### Recruitment Strategy
Our recruitment strategy leverages both digital platforms and personal networks to ensure a diverse and relevant participant pool. Recruitment efforts were conducted primarily through popular social media platforms such as X, Discord, and Telegram. These platforms were chosen due to their high engagement among the Web3 community, which is our research focus. Additionally, we utilized the personal networks of our research team.
The recruitment announcement was crafted to provide potential participants with a succinct overview of the research objectives, the nature of their involvement, and the incentives offered, as follows:

<p style="font-size: smaller;"><i>"We are a team of researchers from [hidden for review], focusing on the exploration of user perceptions towards Web3 auditing.

Interested participants are encouraged to contact XX (Researcher's email)."</i></p>

### Participant Eligibility
Eligibility criteria required participants to: 
1. An understanding of Web3 auditing, as this is central to the discussions and insights we intended to capture.
2. Practical experience with Web3 applications, ensuring that participants are Web3 users.
3. A minimum age of 18 years, to comply with ethical standards concerning consent and participation in research studies.


### Screening Process
The screening process was designed to verify the suitability of participants against the eligibility criteria. This process was conducted through online textual communications, primarily using email and instant messaging. The screening included:
1. A request for participants to briefly explain the concept of Web3 auditing and to provide specific examples from their experiences. This helped assess their depth of understanding and relevance to our study.
2. Inquiries about their primary Web3 applications and the purposes for their use, which helped gauge their level of engagement and the breadth of their experience.
3. Age verification to ensure all participants were legally adults and eligible to consent to participation in research.

Only those candidates who met all the above criteria were invited to participate in the study, ensuring that our research data was collected from well-informed and relevant individuals.
