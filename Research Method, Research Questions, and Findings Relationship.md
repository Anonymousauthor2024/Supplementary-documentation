# Research Method, Research Questions, and Findings Relationship

We have revised the methods section to clearly explain how our approach addresses the research questions (RQs) and derive our findings. To provide a clear understanding of the relationships between methods, findings, and RQs, we have included both a **figure** (showing the relationship between methods and RQs) and a **table** (summarizing the connections between methods, findings, and RQs) to present these relationships visually.

### **Research Method and Research Question Relationship**

The following figure demonstrates the relationship between different research methods and how they address the research questions (RQs):

- **Case Study**: Provides a framework for understanding Web3 auditing and serves as an empirical foundation for analyzing **RQ1** and **RQ2**.
- **Interview Study**: Offers qualitative insights across **all RQs**.
- **Reddit Analysis**: Supplements and cross-validates the findings from interviews.

### **Research Method, Findings, and RQs Relationship**

The table below summarizes the relationship between research methods, findings, and RQs. A check mark indicates which method contributed to a specific finding.

The **interview method** is the main driver for findings across all RQs. **Case study** and **Reddit analysis** provide **empirical verification** and broader insights, enhancing the robustness of the results.

- **Interview Method**:    **Primary source** for most findings, covering **all RQs**.
  
- **Case Study**:   Offers **objective support** for **RQ1** and **RQ2** by reviewing audit firms’ homepage disclosures.
  
- **Reddit Analysis**: 
  - **Qualitative cross-validation** of interview findings on audit perceptions.
  - **Quantitative Supplements**  findings, supplements findings, particularly by evaluating user attitudes through sentiment analysis. This includes assessing both direct discussions on auditing and indirect sentiment expressed through reactions to audit results within applications.
