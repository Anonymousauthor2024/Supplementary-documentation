# Research Method, Research Questions, and Findings Relationship

We have revised the methods section to clearly explain how our approach addresses the research questions (RQs) and derive our findings. To provide a clear understanding of the relationships between methods, findings, and RQs, we have included both a **figure** (showing the relationship between methods and RQs) and a **table** (summarizing the connections between methods, findings, and RQs) to present these relationships visually.

### **Research Method and Research Question Relationship**

The following figure demonstrates the relationship between different research methods and how they address the research questions (RQs):

- **Case Study**: Provides a framework for understanding Web3 auditing and serves as an empirical foundation for analyzing **RQ1** and **RQ2**.
- **Interview Study**: Offers qualitative insights across **all RQs**.
- **Reddit Analysis**: Supplements and cross-validates the findings from interviews.

### **Research Method, Findings, and RQs Relationship**

The table below summarizes the relationship between research methods, findings, and RQs. A check mark indicates which method contributed to a specific finding.
The **interview method** is the main driver for findings across all RQs. **Case study** and **Reddit analysis** provide **empirical verification** and broader insights, enhancing the robustness of the results.

- **Interview Method**:    **Primary source** for most findings, covering **all RQs**.

 
- **Case Study**:  
  Specifically, our **case study** yielded two key results:

  - **Framework for Understanding Web3 Auditing**  
    - This established a **comprehensive framework** for understanding the **interaction of auditing** in the Web3 ecosystem
    - Crucial in supporting the subsequent interviews design.

  - **Empirical Findings from Audit Firm Homepage Review**  
    This provided **empirical validation** for the interview findings. The results from this review contributed to the following key insights:

    - **Findings Related to RQ1**:
      - Highlighted the **insufficiency in the comprehensiveness** of information types disclosed, as noted in Section IV-B.

    - **Findings Related to RQ2**:
      - Identified the **lack of detailed disclosure**, such as missing price information (Section V-B3)
      - Identified the **provision of additional security education materials** (Section V-A3).

**Reddit** is the main source for **online community analysis**, supplementing and cross-validating the interview findings. Two types of analyses were conducted:

1. **Qualitative Analysis**:
   - Based on **thematic categorization**, which cross-validates the interview findings.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Focused on **sentiment analysis**, adjusted to capture the online community's attitudes.
   - These results are used in two ways:
     - To analyze discussions **directly** addressing the role of auditing, as presented in Section V-B.
     - To **indirectly** assess the **impact of auditing** by analyzing the community's attitudes towards different types of audit results for applications, as presented in Section VI-A2.
