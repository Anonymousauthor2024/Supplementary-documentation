We recognize the importance of privacy policy research in conveying information to users and acknowledge the similarities with Web3 auditing, particularly regarding the impact of complex terminology on user comprehension. Measures from privacy policy studies, such as simplifying language, using icons and summaries, and enhancing transparency and standardization, can indeed inform Web3 audit practices.

However, the applicability of these design insights does not imply that the issues addressed are identical. There are key differences between privacy policies and Web3 auditing that lead to distinct user perceptions and design implications:

1. **Differences in Information Delivery**  
   - **Privacy Policies**: These are mandatory agreements that users must accept before using most applications, often without needing to actively retrieve or engage with them.  
   - **Web3 Audits**: Audit results are supplementary security information that users do not typically encounter directly within the application interface. Our research (Section IV-A) shows that users generally reported being able to access audit information. Since users already find this information accessible, there were no additional design recommendations for improving delivery.

   **Design Implication**:  Web3 audits need to focus on the accessibility which privacy policies research do not focus.

2. **Differences in User Initiative**  
   - **Privacy Policies**: Typically government-regulated, with users being passive recipients. The "privacy paradox" highlights how users value privacy but rarely engage with the policy details.  
   - **Web3 Audits**: These are voluntary measures provided by applications to build trust. Users must actively seek out audit information and gather relevant details to evaluate credibility. Our findings (Section IV) show that users are more concerned with the depth, richness, and trustworthiness of the information, creating distinct transparency requirements.

   **Design Implication**: Privacy policies aim to simplify complex terms for passive users, while Web3 audits require providing detailed, transparent information to meet the needs of active, engaged users.

3. **Differences in Application Information Disclosure**  
   - **Privacy Policies**: Disclosure is legally required, even if users don’t engage with it. Privacy policy research focuses on preventing users from overlooking potential infringements on their rights, often through "progressive disclosure."  
   - **Web3 Audits**: These are voluntary security verification measures designed to enhance trust via third-party certification. Unlike privacy policies, Web3 audits focus on user perceptions of audit effectiveness (Section V) and how this information influences behavior (Section VI).

   **Design Implication**: Privacy policies focus on ensuring users don’t overlook important rights, while Web3 audits focus on creating trust through transparent verification. This requires different approaches to disclosure and engagement.

4. **Differences in Authority**  
   - **Privacy Policies**: Developed under official regulations and managed by legal teams. Users typically accept these policies regardless of their perception of authority.  
   - **Web3 Audits**: Conducted by independent external firms with no uniform standards. User trust in the external auditors directly influences the acceptance of audit results. This trust is a critical factor that doesn’t apply to privacy policies. Our study (Section V-A) explores how users perceive audit firms and proposes design implications.

   **Design Implication**: Privacy policies rely on legal enforcement, whereas Web3 audits depend on user trust in external auditors, requiring efforts to establish credibility and transparency in audits firms.

5. **Differences in Educational Role**  
   - **Privacy Policies**: Privacy education is often enforced by government laws, providing users with basic privacy knowledge through mandatory mechanisms.  
   - **Web3 Audits**: In the decentralized Web3 ecosystem, there is no central authority providing privacy education. Instead, Web3 audit firms and decentralized organizations play a key role in educating users about security. This is covered in our design implications.

   **Design Implication**: Privacy policies rely on centralized education, while Web3 audits require decentralized approaches to educate users on security.
