# Quantitative Analysis Results

The quantitative analysis of this study is divided into two steps: **descriptive statistics of categories** and the **significance analysis of differences between subcategories**.

In the phase of descriptive statistical analysis, we comprehensively calculated key metrics across different subcategories, including absolute values, proportions, and mean values. This analysis aims to provide a preliminary understanding of the community's engagement and attention levels towards various discussion topics. Through the examination of these fundamental data, we can **initially observe and interpret the behavioral characteristics of community members**.

Next, we employ Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as the primary tool to **verify the statistical significance of the above-observed differences**. The ANOVA allows us to determine whether discussions on different subcategories lead to significant differences in user behavior characteristics. 
By establishing whether there are significant group differences among the variables **overall**, we further apply post hoc analysis (LSD test) to examine the **specific** manifestations and implications of these differences.

The tables related to our analysis are included at the end of the document.
