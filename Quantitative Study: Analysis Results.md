# Quantitative Analysis Results

The quantitative analysis of this study is divided into two steps: **descriptive statistics of categories** and the **significance analysis of differences between subcategories**.

In the phase of descriptive statistical analysis, we comprehensively calculated key metrics across different subcategories, including absolute values, proportions, and mean values. This analysis aims to provide a preliminary understanding of the community's engagement and attention levels towards various discussion topics. Through the examination of these fundamental data, we can **initially observe and interpret the behavioral characteristics of community members**.

Next, we employ Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as the primary tool to **verify the statistical significance of the above-observed differences**. The ANOVA allows us to determine whether discussions on different subcategories lead to significant differences in user behavior characteristics. 
By establishing whether there are significant group differences among the variables **overall**, we further apply post hoc analysis (LSD test) to examine the **specific** manifestations and implications of these differences.

The tables related to our analysis are included at the end of the document.


### Descriptive Statistical Analysis
This table aggregates statistical measures across various subcategories, providing absolute values and percentages for posts, comments, and involved users. Additionally, it presents average values for comments, upvotes, downvotes, and upvote ratios. Each category is defined by distinct themes as referenced in[Table 1](Qualitative Study: GPT-4 Analysis.md#classification_sample) , where a full description of each category can be found. These statistics objectively reflect the level of community interaction within each category, offering insights into how different topics garner varying degrees of engagement from the community.
