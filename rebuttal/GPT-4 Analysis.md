### Qualitative Analysis Phase: Inductive Approach

In the qualitative analysis phase, we utilized an inductive methodology[1], allowing the classification criteria for Web3-related posts to emerge organically without pre-established categories. The process unfolded as follows:

- **Initial Data Analysis**: Two researchers independently reviewed a randomly selected subset of 100 posts, establishing the groundwork for initial classification criteria.

- **Criteria Refinement**: The team engaged in iterative refinement sessions, addressing discrepancies and fine-tuning the classification criteria through collaborative review.

- **Operationalization of Criteria with GPT-4**: We transformed the evolving classification criteria into GPT-4 prompts, facilitating categorizing posts from the broader dataset.

- **Prompt Refinement**: Multiple iterations of prompt refinement were conducted, based on GPT-4’s performance with a curated example dataset, to ensure the prompts accurately reflected the emergent classification criteria.

- **Systematic Categorization**:  Employing the refined prompts, we systematically categorized all posts, showcasing the adaptability and effectiveness of our inductive approach.

The table below presents the classification criteria:

| **Category**                                              | **Subcategory**                             | **Description**                                                 | **Sample**                                                                                            |
