We appreciate the reviewers’ feedback. We have included all detailed explanations of the study method in the [online appendix](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation) and have revised all presentation issues according to the four reviewers’ feedback as well (see [updated version](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/tree/main/rebuttal)).


**Explanation for Demographic (Reviewer B&D)**:
Our sample size aligns with qualitative research standards [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335652) [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179339). Our community discussions from Reddit, involving 2000+ users, also expand the generalizability of our findings.

As for our experienced sample, 30% of participants have less than 2 years of experience. While these users tend to find audit information harder to understand, trust audits less, and have a more limited impact compared to experienced users, the overall trends are similar. These findings are reflected in our paper.

Meanwhile, we acknowledge the potential limitations in our demographic due to sample size and experience background, and we will add this to the limitations section. The themes and patterns identified in this research provide preliminary insights and a foundation for future studies.


**Removal of Design Implication for Web2 (ReviewerA&C)**:
We acknowledge the significant differences between Web2 and the Web3 ecosystem. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we will remove the design implications related to Web2.

### ReviewerA
**Clarification of the Relationship Between Methods and Findings**:
We have revised the methods section to clearly explain how our approach addresses the RQs and derives our findings. To provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between methods, findings, and RQs, we have included both a figure (showing the relationship between methods and RQs) and a table (summarizing the connections between methods, findings, and RQs). We have also provided a detailed explanation in the [online document](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Research%20Method%2C%20Research%20Questions%2C%20and%20Findings%20Relationship.md).

Specifically:
1. **Case Study** includes two key steps:  
   - **Observing audit information of audited projects**.
   - **Reviewing audit firms' homepage information disclosures**.
     - This provides **empirical validation** for our interview findings.

   Together, these steps form the **interaction framework** for Web3 auditing, which serves as the foundation for the **interview design**.

2. **Interviews** serve as the **primary research method**, uncovering most of the findings.

3. **Reddit Analysis** supplements and cross-validates the interview findings:  
   - **Qualitative analysis** through **thematic categorization** supports the interview findings.
   - **Quantitative analysis**, using **sentiment analysis**, captures online community attitudes.


**Details about Case Study**
We provided details about the case study, including examples of information sources about audit firms. Can be found at:
- [Information source examples](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Case%20Study%3A%20Information%20Sources%20and%20Sample.md)
- [List of 21 audit firm websites](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Case%20Study%3A%20List%20of%2021%20audit%20firm%20websites.csv)

**Validation of GPT-4**  
We greatly appreciate your suggestions for further validation of the GPT-4 analysis. In response, we have made the following updates:

1. We have provided detailed information about the classification tasks using GPT-4 in the [Supplementary-documentation](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Reddit%20Study%3A%20Classification%20Tasks%20Using%20GPT-4.md). This includes the development process and the specific prompts used.

2. We acknowledge the previous limitation of not considering the recall rate. This will be addressed in the updated limitations section. Also, we re-evaluated the recall rates, which were consistently above 80%.

3. For Sentiment Analysis Validation, we have revised the section regarding the ground truth establishment for sentiment analysis using GPT-4 in the [updated version](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/tree/main/rebuttal). A direct explanation is provided in this [document](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/tree/main).

**Consistency in Reporting Findings**: We have revised the findings to report the number of interview participants using absolute values for consistency.（不用单独回应

**Related Work Section Revised**: We have added more details on prior studies in the related work section and moved all RQs to the end of the section for better organizational logic according to your suggestions. You can view the [updated version](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/tree/main/rebuttal).


### ReviewerB

**Rebuttal to Solution Complexity**:
We acknowledge that the widespread adoption of our design implications may take time. 

However, we are collaborating with leading auditing firms and providing practical recommendations. Some of our suggestions have already been adopted, such as CertiK's implementation of data change logs and easily accessible explanations for security metrics calculations (https://skynet.certik.com/).

### ReviewerC

**Comparison with Privacy Policy Research**:

We acknowledge the insights of privacy policy research in conveying information to users and understand its similarities with Web3 auditing, particularly in terms of how complex terminology impacts user comprehension. Measures from privacy policy research, such as simplifying language, using icons, and summaries, indeed provide valuable insights for improving information delivery in Web3 audits.

However, there are significant differences between the two in terms of information delivery, user initiative, disclosure methods, authority, and educational roles. These differences lead to varying focus points in studying user perceptions and necessitate different design recommendations. We have provided a detailed comparison in our [online document](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Discussion%3A%20Comparison%20with%20Privacy%20Policy%20Research.md). 

Your suggestions are valuable, and we are willing to update this comparison in the revised discussion section.

### ReviewerD

**Explanation for 10% of Interviewee Knowing Price Information**:
The 10% of interviewees in our study, which amounts to 2 individuals, learned about price information from friends who had received audit services. The price ranges they mentioned varied significantly, from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. We will update this information in the paper to enhance clarity for readers.
