### Connection among RQs, Methods, and Findings (Reviewer775A)
We have revised the **Method** section to explain how our approach addresses RQs and findings. To clarify their relationship, we added a figure and a table showing the connections between RQs, methods, and findings. We also provided a direct explanation in the [supplementary document](https://github.com/Anonymousauthor2024/Supplementary-documentation/blob/main/Research%20Method%2C%20Research%20Questions%2C%20and%20Findings%20Relationship.md).
