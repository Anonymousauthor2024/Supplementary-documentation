We have fortified the link between our discussion and findings sections to facilitate a more coherent understanding of the study's outcomes. The following points illuminate these enhanced connections:

## Section 7.1: The Unique Characteristics of Web3 Auditing
Draws from the distinctive aspects of Web3 compared to Web2 to contextualize the findings:
- **Section 7.1.1** contrasts the decentralized environment with the symmetrical influence on user decision-making behaviors discussed in **Section 6.1.2**.
- **Section 7.1.2**'s examination of the unregulated industry environment correlates with concerns about audit firm impartiality and independence presented in **Section 5.1.2**.
- **Section 7.1.3**'s discussion on technical complexity as a barrier to usability links to the impact on user behavior explored in **Section 6** and the role of audit firms in security education mentioned in **Section 5.1.3**.

## Section 7.2: Challenges in Web3 Auditing
Addresses challenges from the perspectives of different stakeholders.
- **Section 7.2.1** focuses on the individual-level information gap, associated with the perceptions of information obtained from Web3 auditing in **Section 4**.
- **Section 7.2.2** considers industry-wide challenges, associating with the findings on perceptions of audit firms in **Section 5.1**.
- **Section 7.2.3** tackles the broader community's crisis of trust, which relates to the multifaceted issues surrounding auditing perceptions, impacting information perception (**Section 4**), the perceived role of auditing (**Section 5**), and influences on user behavior(**Section 6**).

## Section 7.3: Design Implications
Responds directly to the challenges highlighted in **Section 7.2**, proposing design suggestions that address the identified issues and illustrating the close relationship between the challenges and proposed solutions.

The thorough interweaving of these discussions with our findings not only bolsters the narrative of our research but also ensures that each point made is grounded in the empirical evidence gathered and analyzed throughout the study.
