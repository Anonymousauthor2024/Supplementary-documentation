Participant eligibility for our interviews is confirmed through textual communication prior to the commencement of the interviews. Only participants who meet our criteria are selected for the interviews. Our interviewing process employs a laddered questioning technique[1] to delve into participants' comprehensive perceptions progressively. 

We begin by exploring the interviewees' experiences with questions such as, ''Could you describe some of the Web3 auditing tasks you remember?'' 
We then inquire in detail about their experiences with Web3 auditing, focusing on aspects including the auditing information (for RQ1), the auditing mechanisms, methodology, and stakeholders (for RQ2), as well as interactions with Web3 auditing (for RQ3).

Subsequently, we pose follow-up questions regarding the framework of knowledge used to shape actions, such as, ''What channels do you usually use to obtain Web3 auditing information?'' and ''In what contexts do you typically learn about audits?'' 

Finally, we explore questions of personal philosophy on Web3 auditing, such as, ''How do you perceive this information? Why do you think that way?'' and ''What is your view on the role of auditing? Is it important to you/the industry/Web3?'' These questions aim to foster a deep and comprehensive understanding of the perception of Web3 users.
