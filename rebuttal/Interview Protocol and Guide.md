# Interview Protocol Guide

Our interview protocol is strategically organized into three sections, each corresponding to our research questions—perceptions of information (RQ1), perceptions of the auditing role (RQ2), and the impact of auditing on user behavior (RQ3). Within each section, we diligently apply the laddered questioning technique to progress methodically through levels of inquiry to foster a profound and comprehensive understanding of Web3 users' perceptions through a multi-layered conversational approach.

We begin with questions about action to explore the interviewees' experiences within our focal themes. For example, "Could you describe some Web3 auditing tasks you recall?" to elicit specific actions related to Web3 auditing.

Next, we shift to questions about knowledge such as "How do you obtain audit-related information?" to understand the frameworks of knowledge that inform actions. This line of questioning encourages respondents to articulate their reasoning processes, as we delve further with questions like "How do you know that?" This approach is designed to extract a more holistic insight, prompting respondents to engage deeply with the narrative unfolding during the interview.

Lastly, we pose questions about philosophy to grasp users’ personal perceptions of the topics at hand. Questions such as "How do you perceive this information? Why do you think that way?" and "What is your view on the role of auditing? Is it important to you, to the industry, or to the Web3 community?" are aimed at uncovering the deeper values and beliefs that underpin their perceptions.
