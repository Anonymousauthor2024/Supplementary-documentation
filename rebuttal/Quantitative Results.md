## Web3 Auditing Discussion Overview According to Categorization
The data provides metrics on post counts, comments, user involvement, and sentiment scores, allowing us to analyze the prominence and user engagement with various Web3 auditing topics. 

Below are some key findings that we will consider integrating into the paper:
- The publication of audit results for applications, regardless of the outcome, tends to increase user engagement, as evidenced by higher numbers of comments, posts, upvotes, and average comments in categories such as halted audits (subcategory 1.3), successful audits (subcategory 1.4), and failed audits (subcategory 1.5), compared to ongoing (subcategory 1.2) and upcoming audits (subcategory 1.1).
- Notably, unsuccessful audit information, including halted and failed audits, triggers more pronounced community conflicts and debates, marked by both high upvote and downvote counts.

- In discussions directly addressing auditing, there appears to be a lack of concern or interest in the auditing mechanism itself, as posts on how audits are conducted (subcategory 2.1) significantly outnumber those in other subcategories but attract notably fewer average replies.

- Regarding Web3 security discussions related to audit firms, there may be a general consensus or absence of debate concerning the security practices of audit firms. Discussions on the security practices of audit firms (subcategory 3.1) engage fewer discussions, indicated by lower average replies and upvotes.

## Web3 Auditing Sentiment ANOVA Results
The ANOVA table details the variance in sentiment across different Web3 auditing discussion subcategories. It shows between-group and within-group variations, enabling the assessment of how sentiment varies within individual subcategories and the overall groupings, with LSD post-hoc tests providing further detail on pairwise comparisons.

Below are some key findings that we will consider integrating into the paper:
- **Overall**: There are significant attitudinal differences among users towards various discussion categories （ANOVA test p< 0.001）.

### Detailed Insights:
- User attitudes towards applications' audit results significantly impact their attitudes, with both positive and negative outcomes (subcategories 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5) standing out from discussions without explicit audit results (subcategories 1.1 and 1.2).
- Notably, successful audit outcomes are associated with positive attitudes, with subcategory 1.4 showing significantly higher average sentiment scores than others.
- Conversely, failed audits are linked to negative attitudes, as evidenced by the lower average scores in subcategories 1.3 and 1.5.

- Regarding attitudes towards auditing itself, there is significant skepticism about its effectiveness, as discussions on the impact of audits (subcategory 2.3) score significantly lower in sentiment than other topics.

- In discussions on Web3 Security, audit firms play a crucial role in risk warning, as indicated by the significant negative sentiment scores associated with audit firms' security knowledge. Upon further examination, we found that audit firms often emphasize potential ecosystem threats to bolster users' security awareness, contributing to the observed negative sentiment.
