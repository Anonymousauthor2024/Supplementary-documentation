## Web3 Auditing Discussion Overview According to Categorization
The data provides metrics on post counts, comments, user involvement, and sentiment scores, allowing us to analyze the prominence and user engagement with various Web3 auditing topics. 

Below are some key findings that we will consider integrating into the paper:
- The publication of audit results for applications, regardless of the outcome, tends to increase user engagement, as evidenced by higher numbers of comments, posts, upvotes, and average comments in categories such as halted audits (subcategory 1.3), successful audits (subcategory 1.4), and failed audits (subcategory 1.5), compared to ongoing (subcategory 1.2) and upcoming audits (subcategory 1.1).
- Notably, unsuccessful audits prompt a more critical stance or controversy, with halted (subcategory 1.3) and failed audits (subcategory 1.5) attracting both high upvotes and downvotes.

- Direct discussions on auditing reveal a community disinterest or response to the auditing mechanism, as discussions on how audits are conducted (subcategory 2.1) outnumber other subcategories but have significantly lower average replies.

- Regarding Web3 security discussions related to audit firms, there may appear to be a general consensus or lack of debate around the security practices of audit firms, with discussions on the security practices of audit firms (subcategory 3.1) engaging fewer discussions, indicated by fewer average replies and upvotes.
