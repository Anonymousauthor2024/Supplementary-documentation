# Quantitative Analysis Results

The quantitative analysis of this study is divided into two steps: **descriptive statistics of categories** and the **significance analysis of differences between subcategories**.

In the phase of descriptive statistical analysis, we comprehensively calculated key metrics across different subcategories, including absolute values, proportions, and mean values. This analysis aims to provide a preliminary understanding of the community's engagement and attention levels towards various discussion topics. Through the examination of these fundamental data, we can **initially observe and interpret the behavioral characteristics of community members**.

Next, we employ Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as the primary tool to **verify the statistical significance of the above-observed differences**. The ANOVA allows us to determine whether discussions on different subcategories lead to significant differences in user behavior characteristics. 
By establishing whether there are significant group differences among the variables **overall**, we further apply post hoc analysis (LSD test) to examine the **specific** manifestations and implications of these differences.

The tables related to our analysis are included at the end of the document.

Below are some key findings that we will consider integrating into the paper:

**Overall**: During the discussions on diverse topics, participants demonstrated notable disparities in their levels of engagement and attitudes. This was quantitatively substantiated by the results of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test across multiple indicators, including sentiment scores, number of comments, upvotes, and downvotes, where the p-values were all less than 0.001.

  **Detailed Insights**:
Regarding the discussion of application audit dynamics:
   - The publication of audit results for applications, regardless of the outcome, tends to increase user engagement, as evidenced by significantly higher numbers of comments, posts, upvotes, and average comments in categories such as halted audits (subcategory 1.3), successful audits (subcategory 1.4), and failed audits (subcategory 1.5), compared to ongoing (subcategory 1.2) and upcoming audits (subcategory 1.1).
   - Notably, unsuccessful audit information, including halted and failed audits, triggers more pronounced community conflicts and debates, marked by both high upvote and downvote counts while negative sentiment scores. Successful audit outcomes, conversely,  are associated with positive attitudes, with subcategory 1.4 showing significantly higher average sentiment scores than others. 

Regarding the direct discussion of Web3 Auditing:
   - There appears to be a lack of concern or interest in the auditing mechanism itself, as posts on how audits are conducted (subcategory 2.1) significantly outnumber those in other subcategories but attract notably fewer average replies.
   - Besides, there is notable skepticism about its effectiveness, as discussions on the impact of audits (subcategory 2.3) score significantly lower in sentiment than other topics.

Regarding Web3 security discussions related to audit firms: 
   - There may be an absence of general awareness of the security practices of audit firms. Discussions on the security practices of audit firms (subcategory 3.1) engage fewer discussions, indicated by lower average comments and upvotes.
   - However, audit firms may play a crucial role in risk warning, as indicated by the significant negative sentiment scores associated with security knowledge shared by audit firms. Upon further examination of the content, we found that audit firms often emphasize potential ecosystem threats to bolster users' security awareness, contributing to the observed negative sentiment.
